 * A Coordinated-Attack window as the clock it is: whatever opens it (a Liberation, a mark on the

 * for a full window (`maxStacks`), fewer where a kit grants a shorter one (Zhezhi's 21 of 27
 * spirits) — and every `every` seconds of the fight clock it summons one `tick` and spends a
 * stack, always on the slot the window belongs to, however far the field has moved on, until the
 * last. A grant on a standing window adds to what it has left (up to `maxStacks`); the cadence
 * runs on from where it was. The kits' own "damage dealt by the summon does not
 * trigger this" comes free: a summon is a queued follow-up, and the clock reads only the frames
 * a press takes.
 *
 * Three places the window can live:
 * - team-held (the default — Zhezhi's Inklit Spirits, Cantarella's Diffusion): granted with
 *   `applyTeam`, ticks onto `owner`'s slot. `owner` is a thunk purely for declaration order —
 *   these sit in a kit's buffs section, above the Resonator const they name.
 * - on the target (Verina's Photosynthesis Mark, Yinlin's Punishment Mark): granted with
 *   `applyEnemy`, nothing else about it differs.
 * - `owner: null` — held by the wearer themselves (Jué's Blessing of Time, granted with
 *   `applyCurrent` by an echo any build can carry, so there is no resonator to name): the ticks
 *   fire with the "current" pointers on the holder, so a plain queue() lands them on them.
 *
 * `applyStats` rides along for a window that is also a buff while it stands — held means it has
 * time left, so it needs no gate of its own (Blessing of Time's own +16% Resonance Skill DMG).
 *
 * `tick` may be a function rather than a summon: then nothing is queued and nothing gets a row —
 * each tick runs it on the owner at its own frame (`applyOn()`), a heal window's heal.
 *
 * `hits` is how many rows one summon fires — for a summon whose single volley is several real
 * hits (Rebecca's turret, 5 shots), fired individually so the detail table's field grouping
 * counts them right.
 *
 * `every` is the summon's own cadence in seconds, fractional where it is (Ciaccona's Tonics, one
 * per 1.65s across thirty-three; Suoming's crests at 4/3s). `onTick` runs after each summon with
 * its ordinal, for a node that counts them (Zhezhi's S5, every third spirit).
